<p>Save my Nails will help you to stop biting your nails, leave this habit, and start admiring your hands.
To help you evaluate your progress, we encourage you to mark in the calendar the days you were able achieve your goals of stop biting your nails. We also encourage you to take a picture of your hands so you can compare how much you've improved. Besides all that, when that feeling comes, we've got you covered we have a great game to distract you and your hands - we are sure that with this game you will be able to distract yourself and you'll never return to bite your nails.</p>
